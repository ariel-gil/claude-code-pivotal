# Literature Review: Nuclear Proliferation

## 1. Introduction

Nuclear proliferation — the spread of nuclear weapons, technology, and fissile material to states and non-state actors — remains one of the most consequential issues in international security. Since the first use of nuclear weapons in 1945, scholars and policymakers have debated the causes, consequences, and control of their spread. This review surveys key theoretical frameworks, empirical findings, and emerging trends in the literature.

---

## 2. Theoretical Frameworks

### 2.1 The Optimism vs. Pessimism Debate

The literature is organized around a central paradox: nuclear weapons are credited with maintaining the "long peace" of the Cold War, yet their further spread is widely seen as destabilizing.

- **Proliferation Optimists** (notably Kenneth Waltz) argue that nuclear weapons impose caution on states. Because the costs of nuclear war are catastrophic, even new nuclear states will behave rationally and avoid provocation. Some optimists have even advocated *selective* proliferation as a stabilizing force.

- **Proliferation Pessimists** (notably Scott Sagan) counter that organizational pathologies — military biases, bureaucratic failures, and inadequate safety protocols — make deterrence failures and accidents far more likely as weapons spread. Sagan's organizational theory approach highlights that new nuclear states may lack robust command-and-control systems.

This debate is central to the field and is well-documented in Sagan & Waltz's *The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: An Enduring Debate*.

### 2.2 Deterrence Theory

Classical deterrence theory holds that nuclear weapons prevent war by making the costs of aggression unacceptably high. Powell's work examines how deterrence theory's implications vary depending on context — what works between superpowers may not apply to regional rivalries or asymmetric conflicts. Critics like Ward Wilson have questioned the very *myth of nuclear deterrence*, arguing the historical evidence for its effectiveness is weaker than commonly assumed.

### 2.3 Security Models of Proliferation

The dominant explanation for *why* states pursue nuclear weapons is the **security model**: states seek them in response to external threats. However, scholars like Sagan have identified two additional drivers:

- **Domestic politics model** — bureaucratic and institutional interests push weapons programs forward.
- **Norms model** — nuclear weapons serve as symbols of modernity, prestige, and national identity.

## 3. Key Empirical Themes

### 3.1 The Nonproliferation Regime

The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT, 1968) and supporting institutions (IAEA safeguards, export controls, Nuclear Suppliers Group) form the backbone of the global nonproliferation regime. The literature generally finds that the regime has slowed proliferation but faces growing challenges from non-signatories (India, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea) and from erosion of great-power consensus.

### 3.2 Cases of Reversal and Restraint

A significant body of work examines states that *abandoned* nuclear programs — South Africa, Libya, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan — as well as states that chose restraint despite having the capability (e.g., Japan, South Korea, Sweden). A 2025 study in the *Nonproliferation Review* uses Swedish data to examine postmaterial values and cultural identity as drivers of public resistance to proliferation.

### 3.3 The Ukraine War and Proliferation Incentives

Recent scholarship highlights how the Russia-Ukraine war has renewed proliferation anxieties. Ukraine's 1994 decision to relinquish its inherited Soviet arsenal in exchange for security assurances (the Budapest Memorandum) is now seen by some states as a cautionary tale — signaling that disarmament can leave a country vulnerable.

---

## 4. Emerging Research Frontiers

### 4.1 AI and Nuclear Proliferation

A growing area of concern is the intersection of artificial intelligence and nuclear proliferation. Research published in *PMC (2025)* examines how large language models (LLMs) could lower barriers to weapons design by substituting machine-generated expertise for scarce human specialists. This is a nascent but rapidly growing subfield.

### 4.2 The Changing Character of Proliferation

A 2024 study in *International Studies Quarterly* argues that the underlying dynamics of proliferation have fundamentally shifted: nuclear technology is more accessible, the geopolitical landscape is multipolar, and the nonproliferation regime faces new stresses. These changes have implications for both theory and policy.

### 4.3 Moving Beyond Deterrence

A 2025 article in the *Nonproliferation Review* proposes a research agenda for "getting beyond nuclear deterrence," arguing that scholars need to develop frameworks for a world where deterrence is not the organizing principle of nuclear strategy.

---

## 5. Conclusion

The nuclear proliferation literature spans realist security logic, organizational sociology, constructivist norms analysis, and emerging technology studies. The field's central tension — between the stabilizing logic of deterrence and the destabilizing risks of spread — remains unresolved. Current events (Ukraine, AI advances, regime erosion) are generating significant new scholarship that challenges long-held assumptions.

## Appendix: Red-Team Critique

This appendix provides a systematic critical evaluation of the literature review above, identifying omissions, biases, factual concerns, logical gaps, source limitations, structural weaknesses, and recency issues.

---

### 1. Major Omissions

The review covers the Waltz-Sagan debate and Sagan's three models competently, but it leaves out several influential theoretical contributions and scholars that any comprehensive literature review on nuclear proliferation should address:

**Missing theoretical frameworks:**

- **Jacques Hymans' psychological/identity model.** Hymans (*The Psychology of Nuclear Proliferation*, 2006) argues that leaders' national identity conceptions — specifically "oppositional nationalist" identities — are the key variable explaining why some states pursue the bomb and others do not. This is a major alternative to purely structural or organizational explanations and has generated substantial follow-on research. Its absence is a significant gap.

- **Matthew Fuhrmann's nuclear assistance theory.** Fuhrmann (*Atomic Assistance*, 2012) demonstrates that civilian nuclear cooperation agreements are a strong predictor of subsequent weapons pursuit. This supply-side explanation complements the demand-side models discussed in the review and has been widely cited.

- **Matthew Kroenig's work on power projection and proliferation.** Kroenig (*Exporting the Bomb*, 2010) examines why states provide sensitive nuclear assistance to other states, arguing it is driven by strategic competition. His later work on the strategic implications of nuclear superiority is also relevant.

- **Etel Solingen's political economy approach.** Solingen (*Nuclear Logics*, 2007) argues that domestic coalitional politics — specifically whether ruling coalitions are inward-looking or outward-looking/liberalizing — are the best predictor of nuclear weapons decisions. This is one of the most cited alternative frameworks in the field and its omission is notable.

- **T.V. Paul's work on nuclear taboo and tradition of non-use.** Paul (*The Tradition of Non-Use of Nuclear Weapons*, 2009) and Nina Tannenwald (*The Nuclear Taboo*, 2007) developed the constructivist argument about normative constraints on nuclear use and proliferation. The review mentions "norms" in passing under Sagan's three models but does not engage with the dedicated scholarship on the nuclear taboo.

- **Vipin Narang's posture theory.** Narang (*Nuclear Strategy in the Modern Era*, 2014) examines how regional nuclear powers adopt different nuclear postures (catalytic, assured retaliation, asymmetric escalation) and what drives those choices. This is critical for understanding proliferation consequences, not just causes.

**Missing empirical cases and topics:**

- **Iran.** The review does not mention Iran at all, which is arguably the single most important ongoing proliferation case. The JCPOA, its collapse, and Iran's enrichment advances are central to any current discussion of proliferation.

- **North Korea's evolving arsenal.** North Korea is mentioned only once in passing (as a non-signatory). The review does not engage with the substantial literature on North Korean nuclear development, testing, or the failure of diplomatic efforts (Six-Party Talks, Hanoi summit, etc.).

- **The A.Q. Khan network.** The most significant case of illicit nuclear supply-side proliferation is not discussed. The Khan network is a cornerstone case for scholars studying how proliferation actually happens in practice.

- **Nuclear latency and hedging.** The growing literature on "latent" nuclear states and nuclear hedging strategies (e.g., Levite 2002-03; Mehta and Whitlark 2017) is absent. This is increasingly relevant given debates about Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and others.

- **Alliance politics and extended deterrence.** The review does not address how alliance commitments (especially U.S. extended nuclear deterrence/"nuclear umbrella") affect proliferation decisions. This is one of the oldest and most active areas of the literature (e.g., Monteiro and Debs 2014; Lanoszka 2018).

- **Nuclear terrorism.** The review mentions "non-state actors" in the introduction but never returns to the topic. The literature on nuclear terrorism (e.g., Allison's *Nuclear Terrorism*, 2004; Bunn and Wier) is a distinct subfield.

---

### 2. Biases

**Theoretical bias toward the realist-organizational axis.** The review is structured almost entirely around the Waltz-Sagan debate and deterrence theory. This gives disproportionate weight to the realist/structural and organizational perspectives while underrepresenting constructivist, liberal, and domestic-political approaches. Solingen, Hymans, and Tannenwald represent major alternative research programs that are either absent or mentioned only in passing.

**Western-centrism.** All cited scholars and sources are from Western (primarily American) institutions and journals. The review does not engage with:
- Scholarship from states that have actually pursued or acquired nuclear weapons (e.g., Indian strategic thought from scholars like Rajesh Rajagopalan, Bharat Karnad, or K. Subrahmanyam; Pakistani perspectives from Feroz Khan or Naeem Salik).
- Chinese perspectives on proliferation and nonproliferation.
- Perspectives from the Global South on the discriminatory nature of the NPT regime (a major theme in non-Western IR scholarship).

**Status-quo bias.** The review implicitly treats nonproliferation as a normative good without acknowledging that this is itself a contested position. Scholars from nuclear-armed states outside the P5 and from non-aligned countries have argued that the NPT regime entrenches inequality. This debate deserves acknowledgment in a balanced literature review.

---

### 3. Factual Accuracy Concerns

- **Section 2.1** states that "some optimists have even advocated *selective* proliferation as a stabilizing force." This should be attributed more precisely. Mearsheimer's argument about a nuclear Ukraine and Waltz's argument about Iran are the canonical examples, but the phrasing "some optimists" is vague. The review should also note that Waltz himself was more cautious than a simple "more may be better" reading suggests.

- **Section 3.2** lists "Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan" as states that "abandoned nuclear programs." This is imprecise. These states inherited Soviet nuclear weapons deployed on their territory; they did not have indigenous nuclear weapons programs. The distinction between inheriting and developing weapons is important in the literature (e.g., Budjeryn, *Inheriting the Bomb*, 2023).

- **Section 2.2** attributes work on deterrence to "Powell" without a first name or full citation. This likely refers to Robert Powell (*Nuclear Deterrence Theory*, 1990), but it could also be confused with Colin Powell. Full attribution is needed.

- **Section 3.3** says "Ukraine's 1994 decision to relinquish its inherited Soviet arsenal" — while the Budapest Memorandum was signed in 1994, the actual transfer of warheads to Russia was a process that extended through 1996. This is a minor point but worth noting for precision.

---

### 4. Logical Gaps

- **The conclusion does not follow from the body.** The conclusion claims the review "spans realist security logic, organizational sociology, constructivist norms analysis, and emerging technology studies." In reality, constructivism receives only a single bullet point (the norms model in Section 2.3), and no constructivist scholars or works are cited. The conclusion overstates the review's coverage.

- **Section 4.2 makes a strong claim without adequate support.** The assertion that "the underlying dynamics of proliferation have fundamentally shifted" is attributed to a single 2024 study. A claim this significant requires engagement with counterarguments — several scholars (e.g., Gavin, Bleek) have argued that the basic dynamics of proliferation have been more consistent than "new era" arguments suggest.

- **No synthesis across sections.** The review presents theoretical frameworks (Section 2) and empirical themes (Section 3) in separate silos without connecting them. For example, it does not discuss how the Waltz-Sagan debate applies to the Ukraine case, or how organizational theory relates to AI risks. A literature review should map how theories have been tested against empirical cases.

- **The "emerging frontiers" section (4) is disconnected from the theoretical section (2).** The AI and proliferation discussion is not linked to any theoretical framework. Does AI-assisted proliferation support the pessimists' case? Does it challenge the security model? The review does not say.

---

### 5. Source Quality and Diversity

**Quantity.** Ten sources is insufficient for a literature review on a topic this large and well-established. A rigorous review of nuclear proliferation scholarship should engage with at least 30-50 sources.

**Type.** The source list is heavily weighted toward journal articles and policy reports. It is missing foundational books that are essential to the field:
- Waltz, *Theory of International Politics* (1979)
- Sagan and Waltz, *The Spread of Nuclear Weapons* (multiple editions)
- Hymans, *The Psychology of Nuclear Proliferation* (2006)
- Solingen, *Nuclear Logics* (2007)
- Fuhrmann, *Atomic Assistance* (2012)
- Narang, *Nuclear Strategy in the Modern Era* (2014)
- Gavin, *Nuclear Statecraft* (2012)
- Mueller, *Atomic Obsession* (2010)

**Journal coverage.** Key journals are underrepresented or absent:
- *International Security* (the most important venue for nuclear proliferation scholarship)
- *Journal of Conflict Resolution*
- *Security Studies*
- *Journal of Strategic Studies*
- *International Organization*
- *American Political Science Review* / *American Journal of Political Science* (which have published influential quantitative proliferation studies, e.g., Singh and Way 2004; Jo and Gartzke 2007)

**One source (Air University)** is a military education publication, which is acceptable but is not a peer-reviewed academic source and should be identified as such.

---

### 6. Structural Weaknesses

- **The three-section body (Theoretical Frameworks, Empirical Themes, Emerging Frontiers) creates artificial separation.** Theory and evidence should be interwoven. As written, the empirical section does not reference any theories, and the theory section does not reference any cases.

- **Section lengths are uneven.** The Waltz-Sagan debate receives substantial treatment while deterrence theory and the three models each get only one paragraph. The empirical sections are similarly thin.

- **No subsection on methodology.** The review does not discuss methodological debates in the field (quantitative vs. qualitative approaches, large-N studies vs. case studies, the role of archival research). Methodological diversity is a defining feature of proliferation studies.

- **The "Sources" section is a flat list.** For a literature review, sources should be integrated as proper academic citations (author-date or footnote format) throughout the text, not listed as hyperlinks at the end. The current format resembles a blog post more than an academic literature review.

---

### 7. Recency and Coverage of Current Debates (2024-2025)

The review makes an effort to include recent sources (three from 2025, one from 2024), which is commendable. However, several major current debates are absent:

- **South Korean and Japanese nuclear hedging.** Both countries have seen significant public and elite debate about acquiring independent nuclear capabilities in 2024-2025. Polling data, policy statements, and academic analyses on these cases are missing.

- **Saudi Arabia's nuclear ambitions.** Saudi Arabia's potential pursuit of enrichment capabilities and the implications for Middle East proliferation dynamics are a major current topic.

- **The future of the NPT after the 2026 Review Conference cycle.** The 2020 RevCon was postponed repeatedly; the broader crisis of the NPT regime is a major current theme.

- **AUKUS and proliferation norms.** The Australia-UK-US agreement to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia has generated debate about whether this sets a precedent that could weaken nonproliferation norms (e.g., regarding HEU transfers). This is a significant 2023-2025 debate.

- **The "new nuclear age" debate.** Multiple scholars and policy analysts have argued that the current period represents a fundamentally new nuclear era characterized by multipolarity, entanglement of conventional and nuclear capabilities, and emerging technologies. The review gestures at this (Section 4.2) but does not engage with the breadth of the debate (e.g., Cimbala, Colby, Roberts, Acton).

- **Escalation dynamics and limited nuclear use.** The Russia-Ukraine war has revived scholarship on nuclear escalation, nuclear signaling, and the possibility of limited nuclear use. This is arguably the most active area of current nuclear scholarship and it is not addressed.

---

### Summary Assessment

This literature review provides a serviceable introduction to the Waltz-Sagan debate and touches on some current developments, but it falls short of the depth, breadth, and rigor expected of a comprehensive academic literature review. Its most significant weaknesses are: (1) the omission of at least four major theoretical frameworks (Hymans, Solingen, Fuhrmann, Narang); (2) the near-total absence of key empirical cases (Iran, North Korea, the Khan network); (3) a source base that is too small and too narrow; and (4) a structure that separates theory from evidence without synthesis. Addressing these gaps would substantially strengthen the review.
