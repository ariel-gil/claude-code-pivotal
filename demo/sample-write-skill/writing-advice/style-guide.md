# Style Guide

<!-- Replace this with writing advice YOU find useful. -->
<!-- Could be excerpts from books, blog posts, or your own rules. -->

## Core Principles

1. **Small chunks**: Break text into short paragraphs. Use section headers
   liberally. Give the reader's eyes places to rest.

2. **Vary the experience**: Alternate between short punchy sentences and
   longer ones. Mix concrete examples with abstract points.

3. **Explicit transitions**: Connect ideas with clear words — "Also", "But",
   "So", "Related to this". Don't make the reader guess how ideas connect.

4. **Concrete before abstract**: Show the example first, then explain the
   principle. People learn from stories, not definitions.

5. **Cut ruthlessly**: If you can remove a word without losing meaning,
   remove it. If a paragraph restates what you already said, delete it.

6. **Plain language**: Use the simplest word that works. "Use" not "utilize".
   "Show" not "demonstrate". "Help" not "facilitate".

7. **Active voice**: "The team built the feature" not "The feature was built
   by the team".

8. **No false certainty**: If you're unsure, say so. Readers trust writers
   who are honest about what they don't know.
