# Being Productive vs Feeling Productive

There's this distinction I keep coming back to. Being productive versus
feeling productive.

Feeling productive is easy. You clear your inbox, reorganize your notes,
set up a new task system. At the end of the day you feel like you did a lot.
But did you actually move anything forward?

Being productive is harder. Sometimes it means staring at a blank page for
an hour. Sometimes it means having an uncomfortable conversation. It rarely
feels satisfying in the moment.

The trap is that feeling productive is self-reinforcing. You get small hits
of completion. Checkbox after checkbox. Meanwhile the actual hard thing sits
there, untouched.

Its about doing the right things. Not doing things right.

Just because its obvious, doesnt mean it isnt worth repeating.
