# Writing Snippets

<!-- PLACEHOLDER SAMPLES — Replace these with your own writing. -->
<!-- Include a range of tones and formats so Claude can learn your full voice. -->

## Snippet 1: Casual / Reflective

<!-- This is a PLACEHOLDER. Replace with your own casual/reflective writing. -->

I've been thinking about this a lot lately. The best tools don't teach you
how to use them. They just get out of the way.

You sit down, you start working, and twenty minutes later you realize you
haven't thought about the tool once. That's the bar. Everything else is
a distraction dressed up as a feature.

## Snippet 2: Technical / Explanatory

<!-- This is a PLACEHOLDER. Replace with your own technical/explanatory writing. -->

The retry logic uses exponential backoff with jitter. On each failed
request, the delay doubles from a 500ms base, then adds a random offset
between 0 and 250ms to prevent thundering herd problems.

This matters because without jitter, every client that failed at the same
time will retry at the same time. You've just moved the traffic spike
instead of solving it.

## Snippet 3: Persuasive / Opinionated

<!-- This is a PLACEHOLDER. Replace with your own persuasive/opinionated writing. -->

We keep building dashboards nobody looks at. Twelve charts, four tables,
a date range picker. The whole thing takes two sprints to build and
nobody bookmarks it.

Here's the thing: if your metric matters, it should show up where people
already are. Pipe it into Slack. Put it in the deploy script output. Tape
it to the wall. A dashboard is where metrics go to die.

## Snippet 4: Instructional / How-To

<!-- This is a PLACEHOLDER. Replace with your own instructional/how-to writing. -->

Start by forking the repo. Don't clone it directly — you'll want your own
copy to push to.

Once you've forked it, clone your fork locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project.git
cd project
```

Create a branch for your change. Name it something descriptive. `fix-typo`
is fine. `patch-1` is not.

## Snippet 5: Formal / Policy

<!-- This is a PLACEHOLDER. Replace with your own formal/policy writing. -->

All production deployments require approval from at least one team lead.
Emergency hotfixes may bypass this requirement but must be reviewed within
24 hours of deployment.

Changes to authentication, authorization, or data retention policies
require review from the security team regardless of scope. No exceptions.
