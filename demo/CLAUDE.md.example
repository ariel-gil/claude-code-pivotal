# Example CLAUDE.md — Personal Workspace Setup
#
# This file goes at the ROOT of your project (or in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md for global settings).
# Claude Code reads it automatically every conversation.
#
# Think of it as "instructions for your AI pair programmer."

## Project Context
- This is a Python project using Flask
- We use pytest for testing
- Database is PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy

## Coding Conventions
- Use snake_case for functions and variables
- Keep functions under 30 lines
- Always add type hints to function signatures
- Prefer f-strings over .format()

## Workflow Preferences
- Run tests before committing
- Write commit messages in imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Never push directly to main — always use branches

## Things to Remember
- The API key is stored in .env (never commit it)
- Port 5000 is reserved for the dev server
- Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to set up dependencies
